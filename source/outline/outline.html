<h2>Course Description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Evolutionary computation is a family of powerful optimization algorithms often used to find solutions to computationally
intractable problems. The study of these algorithms and their application to problems is a large research area within
computer science. Course topics include combinatorial optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization,
search space analysis, multi-objective optimization, and neuroevolution. Research practices and technical writing will
be emphasized for course assignments/projects.</p>

<h3>Breakdown<a class="headerlink" href="#breakdown" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The majority of the marks will come from applying what was learned in class and independent research in a series of
assignments and projects. Most of these marks will be awarded for sufficiently completing tasks as opposed to a
traditional method of losing marks for mistakes. Details for the breakdown for individual assignments will be included
with the assignment description. To gain a general idea, consider the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Implementing an algorithm will award 4 points</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Adding enhancements to the algorithm may award an additional 3 points</p></li>
<li><p>Using the algorithm to solve a more complex problem may award an additional 4 points</p></li>
<li><p>Creating an effective visualization for the algorithm for the problem will award an additional 2 points</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a report will award up to 4 points</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using LaTeX will award an additional 2 points</p></li>
<li><p>Including proper references/citations awards an additional 2 points</p></li>
<li><p>Including figures and tables awards an additional 2 points</p></li>
<li><p>Performing an effective comparison will award an additional 2 points</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Certain tasks cannot be completed without first completing a prerequisite task. For example, a report for the assignment
cannot be completed without first implementing the algorithm.</p>
<p>The reports will be marked in a more traditional way (prose, spelling, grammar, effectiveness, etc.)</p>
<p>If any of this description is unclear, please ask the professor for clarification. If you prefer a conventional grading
paradigm with a typical mark breakdown, please see the professor to make arrangements in the first two weeks of the
course.</p>
</section>
<section id="submission">
<h3>Submission<a class="headerlink" href="#submission" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student’s responsibility
to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the assignment
receiving a mark of zero.</p>
<p>You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment
descriptions. Similarity detection software to identify possible cheating cases will be used.</p>
</section>
<section id="due-dates">
<h3>Due Dates<a class="headerlink" href="#due-dates" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications. No submissions will be taken
after the due date; there are no late submissions. No extensions will be given for assignments.</p>
</section>
<section id="marking">
<h3>Marking<a class="headerlink" href="#marking" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors.</p>
<p>A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available
after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your
assignment). Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why
you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as
well as the original marker’s grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process
is complete.</p>
<p>It is each student’s responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or
inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded
assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials
until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.</p>
</section>
<section id="project">
<h3>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>

<h2>Email Contact<a class="headerlink" href="#email-contact" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Email etiquette</strong> — Emails should be addressed to Dr./Prof. Hughes.</p>
<p>I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email
address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may
wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address.</p>
<p>Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you
let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing
email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding
lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should
check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX
account and include CSCI 340 in the subject line of the email. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during
office hours.</p>

<h2>Office Hours<a class="headerlink" href="#office-hours" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Office hours are provided to students to facilitate their success — students are encouraged to come to office hours.</p>

students solving their problems.</p>

<h2>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Assistant Vice-President Academic
Affairs. See section 3.7 of the academic calendar for more details. You will be reported if you are repeatedly
delinquent in assignments or attendance at classes or laboratories.</p>

<h2>Statement of Academic Offenses and Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#statement-of-academic-offenses-and-academic-integrity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Please ensure that you are aware of the policy on Academic Integrity. Details can be found
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.stfx.ca/media/40111/download">here</a>.</p>
<p>Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.</p>
